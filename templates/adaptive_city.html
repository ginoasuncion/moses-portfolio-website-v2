                We sought to design innovative urban solutions for Bangkok that enhance coexistence in public spaces by fostering community connection and promoting environmental awareness. These solutions address the challenges posed by rapid urbanisation and environmental pressures while celebrating the city’s unique cultural identity.

                We analyzed various public spaces in Bangkok, including parks, markets, and co-working hubs, to understand how they cater to residents and visitors. While some spaces promote social interaction and relaxation, many face challenges such as poor maintenance, limited facilities, and a lack of engaging activities that connect people to environmental issues.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Bangkok’s residents value clean, safe, and well-maintained spaces that foster a sense of community. However, few public areas effectively combine cultural expression, environmental education, and user engagement.

            The key learning from The Adaptive City project is the importance of fostering community-driven involvement and integrating environmental awareness into everyday urban experiences. By focusing on both cultural relevance and sustainability, we created solutions that engage residents and encourage active participation in preserving and improving public spaces. Our design emphasizes interactive experiences, localized solutions, and collaborative action, ensuring that Bangkok's residents are empowered to make a tangible impact on their environment. Through this approach, we learned that urban innovation can thrive when it aligns with the values and behaviours of local communities.
